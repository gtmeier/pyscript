What worked:
1. Separating each shape into its own file let us work in parellel.
2. Use of git helped with error tracing.
3. Everyone synced their editors (4 spaces per tab, etc..) so there were no issues sharing code.
4. Constant refactoring kept the project readable and maintainable
5. The group had excellent communication.

What didn't work: 1. Reading the project assignemnt and understanding it before
stating. George wrote polygon but wasn't able to explain it which lead to
confusiion and wasted time trying to fix the problem of centering odd numbered
shapes which wasn't actually a problem.

2. Drawing a single shape was easy to implement but made drawing difficult.
This is a problem that needs to be addressed at a later time.
